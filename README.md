I like IDV I guess since I've played it since 2018 but I like to think I'm normal about it.

My lifelong special interest is physical anthropology and genetics so sometimes the things I say sound dogwhistley. I try not to talk about it because I know it makes people uncomfortable (for a good reason), just tell me if you feel that way I am not very self aware #aspergers
